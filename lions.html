                    <h3>LIONS</h3>
                    <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, 
                       deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; 
                       adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. 
                       A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying 
                       mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge 
                       when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.</p>
                    <p>Lions spend much of their time resting; they are inactive for about twenty hours per day. Although lions can be active at 
                        any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socialising, grooming and defecating. Intermittent bursts of 
                        activity continue until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and fifty minutes eating.</p>   

                    <p>The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to 
                       being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa, Southeast Europe, the Caucasus, and 
                       Western and South Asia, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in 
                       Sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India.</p> 

                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find the lions at pen L43, in the Northern Fro next to the Panda Canyon.</p>
